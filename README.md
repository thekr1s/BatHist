# Battery History watch face

Aviator like watchface with some color options and many other settings.

Forked from Oliver Bar's <a href="https://github.com/OliverHannover/Aviatorlike">Aviator like watchface</a>.

To build the watchface you need Garmin Connect IQ SDK and Eclipse with Garmin plugins.

This has various additions, such as
* Minor hand change- the simple watch hands can now have no outline
* Updated the stock yellow color (0xFFAA00) to a better 6-bit yellow (0xFFFF00). Hopefully it will not break 16-color
watches- they should just approximate to the closest color they can display
* Starting to add icons for some features, such as phone connection, messages, and alarms
* Some features can be overlaid on the watch hands instead of being obscured by the hands. This may not look
natural like a real watch, but it's useful with so much data being presentsd
* Minor code changes because features seem to have been broken by the newer SDKs
* Moved moon to 22.5 passed whole hour 

Most other features are straight from Oliver's source code, and if you like it, he has a PayPal donation link

Hopefully the latest compiled version of my app is in the
